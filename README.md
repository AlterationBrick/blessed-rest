The brains behind the automated blind control project developed for ENGR 2500, Introduction to Engineering Design at RPI. The project will ultimately incorporate an Android app, Raspberry Pi base station, and Arduino controller. The app and Pi communicate over Wifi via GET requests to a Flask server hosted on the Pi. The Pi and Arduino will communicate wirelessly via NRF24L01 transcievers. The Pi will also be capable of controlling a Phillips smart LED light and playing audio. The Arduino drives motors to raise/lower and tilt Venetian blinds.
